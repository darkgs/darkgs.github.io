## Basis of OOP
Objective Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming design concept to provide more intuitive structure of codes.
As you can see in the name itself, the key concept of OOP is the <b>object</b>.
We can instantiate an object using the <b>class</b> which is so-called the bule print of object.
OOP desires to construct a poject by interactions between objects performing functions indepent to the other objects.
In conclusion, OOP helps us to divide a big project to small pieces of sub-problems for making us to achieve more intuitive understanding of the whole project.
OOP introduces four core principles to make it possible.
